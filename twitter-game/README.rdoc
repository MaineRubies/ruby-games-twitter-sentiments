Thank you for playing ruby games for MaineRuby! Tonight we are building a Twitter Sentiment solution.

**Details**

Create a Rails application that analyzes the sentiments between tweets of two cities to determine which cities are generally "happier".

The user should be able to enter the names of two cities and see a happiness index for both cities.

Don't worry about design! Plain ol' forms for the views are just fine!
